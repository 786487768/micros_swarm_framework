## Introduction
micros_swarm_framework is a programming framework to facilitate application development involving robot swarms. It makes coding for swarms much easier by providing an adequate swarm-level abstraction, as well as tools for swarm management, various communication mechanisms and so on. Enlightened by the Buzz programming language for robot swarms, micros_swarm_framework also provides essential data structures, such as Neighbor, Swarm, and Virtual Stigmergy, to the user. Most importantly, it is completely compatible with ROS Indigo and presented in the form of a C++ library, which means that all resources in the ROS ecosystem are still available to the user. It is currently compatible with ROS Indigo, and is also extensible to Opensplice DDS.
